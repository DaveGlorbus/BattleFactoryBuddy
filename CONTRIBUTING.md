# Contributing
I don't expect there to be many contributions to this repo from anyone but myself, which is fine! There are a number of things that could be improved and I'll try and work out somewhere sensible to document them over time. Below is a bit of guidance on what I'll be after from any changes.

## What matters for the Buddy
I'm going to arrange concerns for the Buddy into tiers. Improvements to anything are unlikely to be accepted if they make something in the tier above worse, or multiple things in the tier below worse.

### Most important
* Accuracy (within the confines of assuming all teams are equally likely).
* Web front-end usability. For someone familiar with the factory it must be easy to use the web page. Both in terms of it being clear what to input and also being clear what the output means.
* Web server usability. You must not need any knowledge of the code to run the server locally. Clicking on things / copy pasting is the ceiling.
* Performance. This has to chug through a lot of teams in some cases and that makes hosting it expensive. We want all queries to return in under 10 seconds (hardware permitting) and most to be borderline instant.
 
### Less important but do care about.
* New features. There's some extra things it'd be cool for the Buddy to have to allow people to make informed decisions.
* Nice code. I've tried to keep it kinda sensible but I'm not going to claim this project is a particularly neat codebase. That said changes should respect the current architecture so it's easier to maintain.
* A snazzy front-end. I'm not a WebDev (shocker, I know), it'd be nice if it looked a bit smoother and e.g. selecting Charizard meant you weren't offered metronome.

## Mechanics of contributing
Send me a pull request I guess? Don't know, this is new territory for me!
